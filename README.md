## Welcome to A Penny On Every Planet

This is the official site of the long desired goal of Abraham Lincoln to place a penny on every planet in our solar system. This website would not be possible without the free service of GitHub Pages and my frightening amount of spare time.

Placing a penny on every planet is part of what it means to be human. This monumental embarkment will change humanity forever. Every man and woman for centuries will be proud of our endeavors. JFK once said in a famous speech, "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard" [(NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/50th/50th_magazine/kennedyLetter.html). We now know that putting a penny on every planet is one of those "other things" that define us as humans and will test the limits of our technological capabilities. This challenge to place a penny on every planet in our solar system began with the moon landings and will be the pinacle of space exploration.

### Seriously, Why?

It may seem a little strange, but honoring our 16th president by placing his face on all the planets will actually aid our advancement in technology and will strengthen our economy.

1. This will bring and estimated 18,000 jobs to our economy, because since this will obviously be the top priority for NASA they will need to hire a temporary 18,000 more employees to run whatever else they were doing before this.
